Help needed from Staff and peers,"Hi Mr./Ms. Staff and Everybody,

I am having some confusion about the logic on the lecture "" *Xbar and Mean, Variance, and Standard Deviation of Xbar .""*

* Assume that we take m **samples** from the population.
* each sample has the size of n **observations**
- We got Xbar_j = sum(xi)/n_j  with i runs from 1 to n while j is a constant in the range of 1 to m.
- Var_j = (1/n)*sum{(xi-Xbar_j)^2}  with i runs from 1 to n
- std dev_j =sqrt(Var_j)
- The population's mean = E(Xbar) = sum(Xbar_j)/m   with j runs from 1 to m.
- Variance of Xbar: (1/m)*sum{(Xbar_j - E(Xbar))^2} with j runs from 1 to m
- Std error: sqrt(Variance of Xbar)

===> SO how can SE = std_dev/sqrt(n)??????

I think there was a mistaken between samples and observations, but I cannot visualize it out.

I hope someone can help me with this, and Thank you!

You assumed that the probability of B2 = 5/9, which is wrong. The sample space if you drew a blue ball on the 2nd draw is {BB, RB} so P(B2) is 5/9 or 6/9 depending on the first draw results. 

Therefore, P(B2) = P(BB) + P(RB) = 6/10*5/9+4/10*6/9 = 3/5. 
Hence P(BB|B2) = (6/10*5/9)/(3/5) = 5/9",16341707,0,0,0,0,,,59fa28babc04a609fe002e06,Microsoft+DAT222x+4T2017,Comment,2017-11-03T05:52:54.047Z

 1. Select all data & format as table (I do that as a habit)

 3. Create new columns for each stock with formula: =[IBM]+1 (if you format as table, you no longer refer to cells, but to column names, that appear automatically like this in your formula if you click on the cell in that column). Same for other stock listings
 4. Create bottom row under the new columns with formula: =GEOMEAN([IBM+1] - 1)
 5. Copy-paste this formula to other stock listing columns

You don't have to format as table, do everything with formulas, calculate all CAGR, etc, but if you work like this, you can later handle large data sets, which is the whole purpose of this course anyway.

M4L1HW1,"The Homework question is:

In 2016, SurveyMonkey and NBC administered web surveys to determine the preferences of voters in each state. Suppose 10,000 voters responded in each state.
Would the preferences obtained from the survey reflect the preferences of all voters in the state? If not, what type of bias has occurred?

 - The sampling plan is not biased.
 - Response bias (correct)  
 - Selection bias   
 - Publication bias

You guys stated ""Response bias"" as correct, which obviously is, but isn┬┤t ""Selection Bias"" also correct?

In the Video, Liberty stated the Problem with a phone survey, as a ""Selection Bias"", because you can only reach people who have a phone. The question states that it┬┤s a web survey, so you can only get people to participate who have internet access.

You should allow both answers, because in my opinion, they are equally correct, or even mark 2 answers for this question as mandatory.

1) **For calculating the daily percentage return** : leave blank the first cell blank in which you are calculating the percentage. In second cell, calculate the percentage using the formula (current day - previous day) /previous day.

2) **For calculating the largest and smallest daily return**: use the large and small functions as discussed in the lecture.

3) **For calculating the 1% daily return**: use the percentile function.

4) **For calculating the percentile for September 17,2007** : use the formula percentrank and check the cell number where your value for September 17,2007 will occur.

Homework on Conditional Probability /2,"I have a query regarding the problem below, Homework on the paragraph on Conditional Probability:

""A bowl contains 4 red balls and 6 blue balls. Two balls are drawn (without replacement) from the bowl. Given that the second ball is blue, what is the chance the first ball is blue?""

Is it a typo when the question is saying ""...Given that the SECOND ball is blue, what is the chance the FIRST ball is blue""...

Does it matter SECOND vs FIRST? if not, can you demonstrate formally, as that is not clear to me.
Does it change the way you solve the problem? If that is the case, please explain...

Bad homework question?,"In the conditional probability homework the 3rd question reads:

*A bowl contains 4 red balls and 6 blue balls. Two balls are drawn (without replacement) from the bowl. Given that the second ball is blue, what is the chance the first ball is blue?*

My question is, how does the first ball you take out depend on the the second ball you take out? I figured the answer would be 6/10=3/5 not 5/9. The probability only changes once a ball has been taken out, if there hasn't been a ball taken out then saying: *what is the chance the first ball is blue?* should be 6/10.",9430088,0,0,0,0,1.0,,,Microsoft+DAT222x+4T2017,CommentThread,2017-10-25T18:54:33.898Z

Can't continue in the Module 5 Quiz,"After I answered the first questions in Module 5 Quiz and click 'Next', the screen below showed up and blocked me to continue.

I tried to re-enter the quiz again for several times within an hour but got the same issue repeatedly.

Can the course assistant reset the quiz for me?

Thanks,

Which formula to use? Do I need to find the p-value first or the t.inv or t.dist?
I've watched it over and over and no idea what to do.
The average test score in the state of Texas is 75. A sample of 25 Dylan High School students yielded x-bar = 74 and s = 5. For ╬▒ = 0.05, would you conclude that Dylan students score significantly different than the state of Texas? What p-value would you report? Assume test scores follow a normal random variable.

    P(NC|NotSa) = P(NC|Peter)*P(Peter) + P(NC|Taylor)*P(Taylor) + P(NC|Sinead)*P(Sinead)

NC stands for No Coupon.  So ""No Coupon"" given that the worker is Peter is (1 - Peter Remembers %)*P(Peter Packaged).  Sum the three probabilities together to get the probability that it was ""No Coupon"" and ""Not Samir"".

Central Limit example excel - periodically update,"Hi,

""Demo  and example CLT"" sheet of Module3Demos.xlsx periodically recalculate itself. I am just curious how it is done. I couldn't find any macro, also automatic recalculation doesn't set in Options-Formula.

Moreover please advise what is ""{=TABLE(,Q6)}"" formula in K25-10004 cells. What is here TABLE? I see no function or name reference like that.

I see I should learn array formula as used in FREQUENCY, not familar with that as well.

Finally not really understand why Central Limit Theory is explained with 10 000 toss. It was explained that 30 toss is large enough for using CLT, my understanding that mean and variance would be compared for 30 doss experience sample means and sample variance instead of 10 000.

,"I suspect Wayne meant those values to be approximate.  If you got something like -13, you might start to worry about it, but -1.3 is probably close enough to -1 that it isn't a problem.

If you're curious, use Excel to generate a collection of 30 random variables drawn from a normal distribution and calculate the skewness and kurtosis of your sample using Excel functions.  Hit F9 a few times to see how they change.  Then try the same thing for samples drawn from a Poisson distribution.

,"Hey Cristian_Masini.

I totally agree with you specially on this:

> A number of imprecision, wrong calculations, ambiguous formulations
> and wrong data sets are present in the exercises.
> 
> *Consequently, a few exercises where the calculations are done
> correctly, are marked wrong by your system.*

This ruined totally my grade on the first quiz and at this point I'm really afraid that I will fail this course, and subsequently, the entire Microsoft Professional Program for Data Science, despite being successful through the other courses of the track.

This weekend I intend to show the ambiguity and misinformation on the quiz that I made, because it is outrageous to ruin an entire 900$ program on a single careless made course.
I hope someone from EDX or Microsoft can take a good eye on this course and reformulate it.

PS:. I would like to add that as I was making the quiz, in the middle of it, I had 80% on the grade (meaning that I succeeded ) and as I continue and fail some other questions my grade turned out to be 64% (meaning I failed the 70% mark). If I left the other questions undone I would passed the quiz.
What kind of course rewards you for not making all the questions? this is ridiculous!

PS2:. Also giving only one submission on the questions is really demotivating, the other courses from Microsoft you have at least 2 chances to answer the questions, and some of them aren't as complex as this one.

PS3:. And when you submit the answer on the quiz you don't have the justification of that result, this doesn't help on the learning process at all.",7898110,0,0,0,0,,,5a00b1deaf36f315a4000319,Microsoft+DAT222x+4T2017,Comment,2017-11-09T17:17:53.703Z

mutually exclusive events example math,"The 2nd video found in Module 2 : Basic Probability | Mutually Exclusive and Independent Events | Mutually Exclusive Events and Finding Prob (A or B) section has title ""Mutually Exclusive Events in Excel"" and is delivered by wayne.  It contains an example involving A, B, C in the top left side of the spreadsheet.

In the review of that example wayne discusses calculating P(A or B) given A and B are not mutually exclusive events.  The example walks through arriving at the results by manually accounting for P(A and B) for use in P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B), i.e. 3/12 + 3/12 - 1/12 = 5/12.

What has me confused is why the P(A and B) portion doesn't produce the same result if you use probability math that so far has stated P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B), i.e. 3/12 * 3/12 = 9/144 = 1/16.  Using probability math, versus being able to rely on diagram and manually count P(A and B) i get P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) = P(A) + P(B) - (P(A) * P(B)) = 3/12 + 3/12 - (3/12 * 3/12) = 6/12 - 1/16 = 0.4375 which does not equal the 5/12 = 0.4167 discussed in video.

Any insights you folks can provide on why in this case probability math P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B) cannot be used to arrive at same result wayne arrives at by just visually pulling that probability from diagram?",13739955,0,0,0,0,8.0,,,Microsoft+DAT222x+4T2017,CommentThread,2017-11-06T04:47:19.576Z

,"Hi, Our goal at Microsoft is to improve the speed at which our learners achieve mastery of a subject. As Liberty mentioned in her email to students, we are experimenting with several different ways to deliver this content. The pretest allows us to compare your knowledge prior to starting the course with that achieved upon completion; this comparison will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of each delivery method. Keep in mind that pretest is only worth one homework point. To earn that point, you must answer at least 34 questions. If you answer fewer questions, you will be awarded a fraction of that point based on the proportion of the 34 items that you did answer. This score is NOT based on the number of questions you answer correctly; it is based on the number of questions that you attempt. Thanks for taking the time to attempt the pretest; your participation will help us better understand how our various delivery designs affect the speed with which students achieve mastery.",12639383,0,0,0,0,,,59f60ae0bc04a609f0002893,Microsoft+DAT222x+4T2017,Comment,2017-10-31T10:27:14.458Z

So annual return becomes this:

2007 -> 0.00, 2008 -> 0.18, 2009 -> -0.03, 2010 -> 0.07, 2011 -> 0.11, 2012 -> 0.06, 2013 -> 0.05, 2014 -> 0.12

Adding 1, then calculating CAGR:

(1.00 * 1.18 *  0.97 * 1.07 * 1.11 * 1.06 * 1.05 * 1.12) ^ (1/8) => 1.067495 => 6.7%

"suggest adding pre-test ""i'd be guessing"" choice to all questions","My understanding is the pre-test is intended for instructors to analyze results of student's knownledge before taking the course and after taking the course when each of the graded module quizzes are taken.

That being the case i'd suggest adding pre-test ""i'd be guessing"" choice to all questions. Thinking being that currently when i take the pre-test if the question covers something i haven't previously learned or have limited understanding of i can guess and get a certain portion of the questions correct.  

Wouldn't those guesses throw off the accuracy of any analytics that are done to compare pre-test results against results of doing module quizzes after having watched course lectures and done all the homework assignments?",13739955,0,0,0,0,4.0,,,Microsoft+DAT222x+4T2017,CommentThread,2017-11-12T02:45:13.720Z

Don't understand homework answer,"Question M4L1HW1: ""What kind of bias occurred when Monkey Survey sampled voter's preference in US Presidential election through a web survey?""
I would think it's selection bias, since only those respondents who have internet and are willing to fill out surveys responded. So the selection of the sample has flaws (i.e. over representation of unemployed).

The correct answer however, is ""response bias"". Could anyone explain please what I'm missing here?",13103099,0,0,0,0,7.0,,,Microsoft+DAT222x+4T2017,CommentThread,2017-11-12T11:09:18.255Z

,"Actually, now that I've had time to think about it, I'm not sure I'm 100% there yet.
Maybe one more example will clarify it for me.
How about this:
The first runner up in this year's Miss America pageant: Ordinal or nominal?
I could make the argument that it's ordinal... there is a winner, a first runner up, a second runner up, etc. 
But by the definition used for my favorite restaurant chain, there is no ""natural"" order between the ladies selected. 
While I agree that there is no natural order between the actual first runner up and any of the ladies who didn't even get into the top 5, there IS a natural order between the winner, the first runner up, etc. as rankings within the Miss America pageant. 
That's my argument about the favorite chain: it's not that MY particular favorite chain is inherently special in any way, but the fact that it's considered a ""favorite"" puts it in a ranked order. You'd have to agree that regardless of who is choosing, their favorite is always the top among a series of other choices. The concept of a favorite implies a natural order ""favorite to least favorite"", regardless of the items placed there or by whom.
All of this is moot if you tell me that the First Runner Up in the Miss America Pageant is nominal, since it would at least be logically consistent with your previous answer. 
But if you answer that it's ordinal, I'm going to be hopelessly confused.

,"You're correct that each time you roll the die the outcome is not dependent on previous outcomes. However, that's not the way to look at it.  The sample space is the same as if you were rolling five dice at once, and asking the chance of at least one of them coming up with a two.  If you remember the example of rolling two dice, out of 36 possibilities there was a cell that represented getting a two on both dice.  That cell had to be subtracted out of the favourable outcomes when you added them up, 6 + 6 -1, or 11/36.  (6 chances to get a 2 on die A, 6 chances to get a 2 on die B, and one chance to get a two on both dice at once).  Notice also that the suggested approach gives (1 - 5/6 * 5/6) or (1 - 25/36) or 11/36 - same answer.  This question deals with five dice, so unless you're good at visualizing a five dimensional space, it gets a little tricky to count the cells.  Again, the five rolls are independent of each other, just like five separate dice are independent, but the sample space counts outcomes, which are not independent.",2556761,0,0,0,0,,59ea6b214ed74909ee0022ea,59e8ceb44ed74909f400221b,Microsoft+DAT222x+4T2017,Comment,2017-11-04T04:14:27.207Z

,"Typically if you are making a number of trials of the same type, such as rolling a die, flipping a coin, drawing a card, then the sample space is the number of outcomes of each trial raised to the power of the number of trials.  So three die rolls gives you a space of 6^3, ten coin flips would be 2^10, five cards drawn would be 52^5 (assuming you are replacing the card and reshuffling each time).  Factorials get involved when the sample space involves arrangements of items in a particular order.  For example what is the chance that you could shuffle five cards and deal them out in increasing order, ace, two, three, four, and five.  That's one arrangement of a sample space of 5 factorial, or 1/120.",2556761,0,0,0,0,,,59f627a94ed74909bd0029ec,Microsoft+DAT222x+4T2017,Comment,2017-11-04T03:39:30.199Z

As Liberty mentioned in her email to students, we are experimenting with several different ways to deliver this content. The pretest allows us to compare your knowledge prior to starting the course with that achieved upon completion; this comparison will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of each delivery method. Keep in mind that pretest is only worth one homework point. To earn that point, you must answer at least 34 questions. If you answer fewer questions, you will be awarded a fraction of that point based on the proportion of the 34 items that you did answer. This score is NOT based on the number of questions you answer correctly; it is based on the number of questions that you attempt. Thanks for taking the time to attempt the pretest; your participation will help us better understand how our various delivery designs affect the speed with which students achieve mastery.",6606528,0,0,0,0,,,59ef598fbc04a60a2b002557,Microsoft+DAT222x+4T2017,Comment,2017-10-27T13:37:56.729Z

,"I think there is a general confusion to the question but (since I got it right) it is asking you to rank the intensity of the skew.  

Use the SKEW() formula and this should give you a better understanding of it. The skew gives Gold: 2.23, REIT: -0.8, and Bonds: 0.31. 

As you approach zero (either from positive or negative) your skewness goes down. Gold is the most skewed because it is furthest away from zero, REIT the second because it is 0.8 because the negative is irrelevant when speaking about intensity, and finally Bonds because it is closest to 0.

,"Totally agree. A very long pre-test where the files aren't provided to answer the questions on material we haven't been taught yet made me think that it was deliberately supposed to be impossible and function as simply a measure of our current knowledge. So (apart from the probability questions and the ones I could have a stab at, some of which were very poorly worded) I just clicked random answers all the way through. Then found out it was graded... 

I get that you (course providers) want to measure knowledge improvement (a pre-test!) but there was no context given and it was tiresomely long, not to mention extremely demoralising.

,"@MalikaS_Lex, thanks for the screen shot of details on how to arrive at solutions to these problems.  

Its not landing on me how the ""Mean for 1 Game"" is the winning probability - losing probability and why it isn't something like winning probability + losing probability / 2.  Any insight you can provide to help clarify what i'm missing on that.  

Similarly the statistical formula you are using for ""Variance for 1 Game"" appears to be X1^2*P1 + X2^2*P2 - Xbar^2 which going back to earlier courses looks to be some version of the formula for variance of a discrete random variable, E(X^2) - E(X)^2, which does not reference Xbar in the subtraction.

Once those two values at determined its clear how the ""Mean/Variance for 10000 Games"" is arrived at using law of total probabilities that we learned earlier.

From here I see the final probability of coming out ahead being calculated by what looks to be use of law of complements, i.e. 1 - probability of coming out behind in which case for X in 1 - NORM.DIST(X, mean, sd, cdf or pdf) the answer says its using 0.5.  Is that 0.5 meant to be a rounded off version of the ""Losing probability"" = 0.507?

How come we can't generate the probability of coming out ahead using the ""Winning probability"" = 0.493, e.g. NORM.DIST(0.493, -140, sqrt(9998.04), true) = 0.9199 ?",13739955,0,0,0,0,,5a0e1a4a0c1c9816b2000b53,59f00ff150ef2209de002644,Microsoft+DAT222x+4T2017,Comment,2017-11-19T20:54:52.035Z

,"- using normal distribution we get the probability of a bottle has less than or equal to 395 mg.
- P(<=395) = NORM.DIST(395, 400, 20, TRUE) = 0.40129
- Since 40.129% of the case that each bottle has 395mg or less. We call the success event (A) as bottle with less than or equal to 395mg. So P(A) = 0.40129.
- Using binomial rule we get: the probability of 25 bottles in a sample of 25 bottles have 395mg or less is:

,"Thank-you for raising this issue. I have the same problem after correctly answering question 1 (Adapt 4) on the final exam. I only have four days left on my Office 2016 trial, and today is the only one of those days I'm not working. I specifically cleared my calendar so that I could complete this today before the trial runs out, as I have a perfectly good copy of Office Pro Plus 2013 I will reinstall after this exam is done. It seems the only module in this course that specifically requires Excel 2016 is Module 1, for the boxplots and histograms, but obviously the final exam will contain these types of questions so I need the 2016 version until I complete the exam. And, I need to complete this course to obtain the two Microsoft certificates I'm working towards. If that weren't the case, and if I hadn't already paid good money for this course and the others in the certificate, I would have dropped it weeks ago. Honestly this is kindof the final straw for leaving me really very frustrated with this course, given that it is riddled with errors and oops-es. The other courses I've taken towards the certificates have all been well done, but I have spent so much time on this one trying to figure out missing or wrong files, misleading wording on questions, homework questions with no explanation of steps used to arrive at the answer, and homework and quiz questions with 'correct' answers that after multiple, careful reviews I really think are wrong (detrimental to learning, a huge waste of time, and frankly stressful when it brings your grade down), etc., not to mention the 60+ question quizzes with often 8 or 10 versions of exactly the same solution process, which are above and beyond the difficulty level and time commitment norm I've come to expect from an edX/Microsoft course.

I'll also submit a Help Center request, and I do hope edX and Microsoft can provide a suitable, timely solution.

,"Hi All, I agree these homework problems aren't really easy to prepare for after watching the videos. I think the problem is that the explanation answers aren't specific enough on where the numbers were derived from. I was able to get help from some folks for #1 , but still having issues on #2 , and #3. 

for #2 - the explanation is """"=1-NORM.DIST(20,0,23.81,TRUE)"" - but what's confusing is where was 23.81 generated from. I was able to work back that you square the STDV and * it by 252 and square it to get ""0.023811762"" - but why are the decimals over? Why is it 20 , no .20 ? It's not asking if it's rising 20 points, but 20% ?


And for #3 I seem to be calculating the standard deviation wrong ? ![Candy Store][1]

M2L4HW3 clarification,"in Module 2 : Basic Probability | Conditional Probability | Homework | M2L4HW3 | question 3 it asks ""A bowl contains 4 red balls and 6 blue balls. Two balls are drawn (without replacement) from the bowl. Given that the second ball is blue, what is the chance the first ball is blue?""

The 5/9 selection exposed ""show answer"" explanation states ""Just take 2nd ball out. If it is blue, there are 9 balls left (5 blue and 4 red), so now the chance that the first ball is blue is 5/9.""

What is wrong about the following probability math being used to try and arrive at that same answer?
sample space [S] is 10 balls with 4 red and 6 blue,

The mean is calculated using SUM of all events multiplied by their respective probabilities. So for a single dice, it means 1/6 * 1 + 1/6 *2............

And, if you calculate for 2 dies then you need to multiply each event by its respective probability.

Like: 1/36 *2 +2/36 *3+3/36*4........

When I truncate my answer to two decimal places I get an answer that was included in the answers, and it was marked correct.  This suggests that  a) the problem writer didn't know how to round,  b) a typo in the answer, or c) something else happened.

,"One important thing to remember is that getting the same results in a different order is considered a different result. So HHHT is a separate outcome to HHTH even though both outcomes have 3 heads and a tail. When the order matters like this we call each outcome a PERMUTATION. If hypothetically the order didn't matter and we were just counting the total heads at the end those outcomes are called COMBINATIONS.

2) For calculating the largest and smallest daily return: use the large and small functions as discussed in the lecture.

Discrete Random Variable ,"Hi, 

The video on Discrete Random Variable where throwing a die 6 times, should have the outcomes 1 - 6. 
The probability is to be equal for each of the numbers within, with the probability mass function (PMF)  range of 100% 

The graph on the excel handout and video it shows 90% with 5% sitting from 0-1 and 6-7. 
With a 6 sided dice it always be within 1-6, (PMF) 100% of the time. 

Am i missing something? 
Many thanks, 

Please see screen shot:

I'm stuck trying to undersand how you goit the variance of 3320.8 for M3L3HW3, The abswer hint says (use the variance from q2 times 100). Thats a pretty bad explaination. Q2 M2L2HW1 Q2 , gives the insightfult answers (Variance is 33.2), which is not much of an explanation. 

My understanding of the variance, is that it is the ""Weighted Distance from the mean for each calculation, squared"". Since the mean is -5.26, (mean of one toss is -0.052) each losing 1 dollar bet(37/38 or 97 percent) would calculate as -0.97 (1  dollar * 97 percent) with a squared distance from the mean of (-.97- -0.052)^2 =  (-0.92)^2 = .85  and each winning 1 dollar bet (1/38 or 3 percent) would calculate as .92 (35  dollar * 3 percent) with a squared distance from the mean of (.92 - -0.052)^2 = (.97)^2 = .95.. Summing these we get .85+.95 = 1.76 .. I assume I can multiple times 100 to get the variance of 1176. 

My understanding of the variance, is that it is the ""Weighted Distance from the mean for each calculation, squared"".

Histogram overlap Question,"Hello!
I'm confused about the notations and functionality of the bins in the Histograms.  Liberty said that they do not overlap.  But many of the examples show the bins with overlapping numbers, for example:  :[>=55] [55,65], [65,75]...etc.  So what bin does data that equals 55 go in? 65? 75?  The lower or the upper bin?

M2L2HW1 - Trying to understand why the variance in the roulette table is 33.20 ,"I'm stuck trying to understand how you got the variance of 3320.8 for M3L3HW3, The answer hint says (use the variance from Question 2 times 100).
Q2 M2L2HW1 Q2 , gives the insightful answers (Variance is 33.2),  with no explanation, which is not helpful. 

My understanding of the variance, is that it is the ""Weighted Distance from the mean for each calculation, squared"". Since the mean of 100 tosses  is -5.26, (mean of one toss is -0.052) each losing $1 bet (37/38 or 97%) would calculate weighted as -0.97 ($1 * 97%) with a squared distance from the mean of (-.97- -0.052)^2 =  (-0.92)^2 = .85  and each winning $1 bet (1/38 or 3%) win $35 and would calculate as .92 ($35 * 3%) with a squared distance from the mean of (.92 - -0.052)^2 = (.97)^2 = .95.. Summing these we get .85+.95 = 1.76 .. I assume I can multiple times 100 to get the variance of 1176. 

That is not a choice .. Where is my logic messed up .. I saw that I can use the formula E(X^2) - E(X)^2 = =((36^2*37)/38)-((36*37)/38)^2  , and that does seem to get the 33.20 you are looking for .. however I don't understand why that works .. Any insights ... I hate magic.. I'm trying to understand why that formula is the same as the ""Weighted Distance from the mean for each calculation, squared""",15454311,0,0,0,0,4.0,,,Microsoft+DAT222x+4T2017,CommentThread,2017-10-25T09:18:27.559Z

Please review the Pre Test,"In my opinion, the Pre Test is too long & hinders the learner. 

There are too many similar, duplicate questions looking at the same skills. Presumably people are taking this course to learn new skills. It is frustrating to be asked several questions about a topic you are unskilled in. I'm about 30 questions in and I read another person was 60 questions in and still going. This is genuinely demotivating. It takes a significant investment of time but offers zero value to the learner. 

The pre test should be dropped entirely, or shortened. If kept but shortened, what I would propose is to order the test through each section and start with simple questions and progress on to more challenging questions. There should be an option to answer a question with ""not familiar with subject"" which auto skips on to another subject area, rather than forcing you to guess.",14741107,1,0,1,1,4.0,,,Microsoft+DAT222x+4T2017,CommentThread,2017-10-27T13:37:56.733Z

,"Banyon, LindaHV,

I had the same thinking as Banyon, that it was ordinal.  Favorite clearly implies rank, thus ordinal.  The topic of 'natural' helped me sort of, but even in the videos one of the examples of ordinal was rating a teacher, excellent to poor.  My rating of the teacher belongs to me; it's also not inherent in the teacher.  (which maybe why he mentioned such ratings are controversial? :))  A rating of a teacher would be ranked by an individual, not a natural order of things as in the school type example. Like Banyon I want to make sure I'm understanding this.

,"Hi all,

The pre-test is random for everyone, so the total number of the questions is uncertain.

The pre-assessment is worth 1 point, and as long as you answer at least 34 questions, you will earn the point. If you answer less than that, you get the fraction of the point that is equivalent to the percent that you answered. It has NOTHING to do with correctness, though. It is entirely based on the number answered. We did this because we need a good baseline of your preknowledge to evaluate the effectiveness of our experimental designs on your knowledge after the course. By adding a tiny bit of importance to the pretest by making it worth 1 point, we are hoping that students will take the time to do the pretest. Note that the pre and post surveys are also worth a point in the homework and this is no different.

M2L4HW1 formula : P (win at least once) = 1 - P(never win) = 1 - (37/38)^25 = 0.49.  Key is to note that Prob you lose each time is (37/38)(37/38)....(37/38) 25 times. 

M2L4HW2: We assume B = Bachelor viewer, M = Man, W = Woman. The probability of Man is 0.5 P(M)=0.5, the probability of woman is 0.5 P(W)=0.5. There are 10% of all adults watch ""The Bachelor"" television program. So the probability of Bachelor viewer is 0.1 P(B) =0.1.  There are 80% of ""The Bachelor"" viewers are women, so the probability of woman in ""The Bachelor"" viewers is 0.8  P(W|B) =0.8. That a given person who is a Bachelor viewer and who is also a woman Bachelor viewer is P(B AND W) = P(B) * P(W|B) =0.08. Last the given person is from all adults, so if you want a given woman the probability need to be divided by 0.5, P(B|W) = .08/.5 = .16.

What really matters is how much the distribution of the maximum interval and the minimum interval. There are many very large gold returns between 0.36 and 1.2, so gold returns have most spread. Bond returns are entirely between -11% and 33%, so Bonds have the least spread.

,"OK, sorry to keep harping on this, but I'm a classic INTP. These things matter to us. 
I just found this on the website http://www.usablestats.com/lessons/noir:

""Ordinal refers to quantities that have a natural ordering. The ranking of favorite sports, the order of people's place in a line, the order of runners finishing a race or more often the choice on a rating scale from 1 to 5...""

Note the first example they use, ""the ranking of favorite sports"". Now I know that favorite sports aren't any more natural than favorite restaurant chains. 

Is there anyone higher up the food chain we can ask about this? A couple of different PhDs or something? I'm beginning to think the answer to that question is incorrect and that whoever wrote is as confused about this particular type of example as I am. 

It's not that I care about the question itself in this context, but it's important that I understand the concept precisely; otherwise, I'll be getting a pretty fundamental piece of statistics confused for the rest of my life. 

Thanks! And sorry!",5516957,0,0,0,0,,59ef029450ef220a2300258d,59ecb17e50ef2209ed002378,Microsoft+DAT222x+4T2017,Comment,2017-10-24T09:24:24.236Z

T.INV is use to get the percentile of T random variables.

T.DIST to get the T probabilities, when it is >=, use 1-T.DIST and when it is < , use T.DIST

,"Hi, we have given the probability of winning in the question i.e. 0.493 and  we know the p value lies between 0 and 1. So we subtract the probability of winning from 1 to get the value of loosing.  and we got 1-0.493 = 0.507. Using SUMPRODUCT, we can get the mean value and then variance. 

Also, you can use the complete value of loosing while getting the probability of ""not loosing"" as =1- NORM.DIST(0.507,-140,99.9902,TRUE)

 **Please [click here](https://products.office.com/en/buy/compare-microsoft-office-products?tab=omac) to see if Office 365 Home trail work for you**.


""See [this 9to5mac website][11] that does a pretty nice job of laying out the some of the major differences between the Windows and Mac versions and [this parallels website][12] that lays out some major features that are in Windows but not in Mac versions. 

**Note:** The only charts not supported in the Office 2016 Mac version but requested in this course are **boxplot, tree-, and sunburst charts.**  To complete some practice, you have to install some Excel-Add-Ins first, which you can find under Extras->Excel-Add-In->Data Analysis Toolpak/Solver. 

  [11]: https://9to5mac.com/2016/01/21/windows-mac-ipad-microsoft-office-comparison/
  [12]: http://blog.parallels.com/2014/04/18/the-differences-between-excel-for-mac-and-excel-for-windows-2/

If you don't already have Excel for Mac installed on your Mac then your only option might be to attempt to create a parallel installation (see the parallels website for that) and then install the 30 day trial version of Excel provided with this course. Alternatively, you can see if you can find a free trial version of Excel for Mac available on the web.""

,"Thanks. So we're looking for the Posterior Probability = P(Correctly identified | Green cab) - is that correct? If so, I still get a different answer... 
Posterior Probability = P(Correctly identified | Green cab) = P(Green cab AND Correctly identified)/P(Green cab)
where P(Green cab) is the total probability of P(Green Cab and correctly identified)+P(Green Cab and incorrectly identified) = P(Correctly Identified)*P(Green Cab|Correctly Identified) + P(Incorrectly Identified)*P(Green Cab | Incorrectly Identified) = 0.8*0.8+0.2*0.2 = 0.68.
The numerator is =P(Green cab AND Correctly identified) = P(green cab | correctly identified)* P(Correctly Identified) = 0.8*0.8 = 0.64.
So the posterior probability is 0.64 / 0.68 = 0.94

Where am I going wrong?

,"I think it would make more sense to make it an all or nothing score, based on whether you took the pre-test, or not.  If you took the pre-test, regardless of score, you should show as 100% in homework (report the actual score on the test elsewhere, but not as a homework score). The only time you would show as something other than 100% is if you did not attempt the test. 

It's true that if you calculate the score achieved in the pre-test and its impact on your overall score, it's truly minimal.  However, it still reflects an inaccuracy, however small, in your overall course score.  It also increases stress level (the score actually matters).

,"Hi Myusrn

The formula ""mean = =1/11 * (2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10+11+12) * 50 = 350"" you use to calculate mean is wrong.

Below is the correct analysis:

S = {2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12} 

P(s=2)=1*1/6*1/6 = 1/36

P(s=3)=2*1/6*1/6 = 1/18

P(s=4)=3*1/6*1/6 = 1/12

P(s=5)=4*1/6*1/6 = 1/9

P(s=6)=5*1/6*1/6 = 5/36

P(s=7)=6*1/6*1/6 = 1/6

P(s=8)=5*1/6*1/6 = 5/36

P(s=9)=4*1/6*1/6 = 1/9

P(s=10)= 3*1/6*1/6 = 1/12

P(s=11)=2*1/6*1/6 = 1/18

P(s=12)=1*1/6*1/6 = 1/36

mean=(2*1/36+3*1/18+4*1/12+...+12*1/36)*50=350

,"Hi, MeDale

Follow the following steps to calculate :

1) For calculating the daily percentage return : leave blank the first cell blank in which you are calculating the percentage. In second cell, calculate the percentage using the formula (current day - previous day) /previous day.

2) For calculating the largest and smallest daily return: use the large and small functions as discussed in the lecture.

3) For calculating the 1% daily return: use the percentile function.

4) For calculating the percentile for September 17,2007 : use the formula percentrank and check the cell number where your value for September 17,2007 will occur.

Use the formula NORM.DIST(x,mean,standard_dev,cumulative) to get the right answer.

X     Required. The value for which you want the distribution.

Mean     Required. The arithmetic mean of the distribution.

Standard_dev     Required. The standard deviation of the distribution.

Cumulative     Required. A logical value that determines the form of the function. If cumulative is TRUE, NORMDIST returns the cumulative distribution function; if FALSE, it returns the probability mass function.",16524953,0,0,0,0,,,5a038b424ea04c1692000539,Microsoft+DAT222x+4T2017,Comment,2017-11-09T07:57:29.208Z

When i read this i don't see what i'm looking for that tells me this is a P(M|Zm) or a P(Zm|M) or a P(M and Zm) probability that is being expressed, where M = male and Zm = zoology major. Not being able to accurately detemine which kind of relationship will lead to incorrect probability calculations and no idea that you are making incorrect conclusions. 

Any insights as to how one determines when a sentence discussing a probability relationship is expressing an AND or a GIVEN [ / Conditional ] relationship?

Of course, it was kind of proven useless later because the game creators updated on which bait would be best to use on which type of fish. Still, it was interesting to see. Since then and even previous self projects, I have been trying to make one that would keep up with my life style etc. That type of project has been proven much harder to create, especially with so many possible variables one can use.

,"Kamhung, you figured it out already? Maybe if we work together, we can find the solution? This is how far I got:
The chance of throwing 5 or 6 on a die is the same as the chance of throwing 3 on a three-sided die. So I'll use a three-sided die to make things easier.

The formula I think we need is Laplace: number of successes / number of possibilities.
Number of possibilities is 3^6=729
Number of successes is: P(4 times 3)+P(5 times 3)+P(6 times 3), which is 15+6+1=22.
22/729=3.02% chance that this happens at random. Which is not one of the given answers.

Kamhung, how far did you get on this one? Or is there anyone else who can help? I already enlisted two friends' help, but they are stuck as well!

X in the ""E(X^2) - E(X)^2"" expression  is not meant to refer to Xbar.
Below is an example to help you understand  ""variance = E(X^2) - E(X)^2"": 

P{X=1} = 2/3,P{X=0} = 1/6,P{X=-1} = 1/6.

suggestion: calculating probability of having cancer and getting negative test result,"Hi,

I would suggest to calculate the subjected as well to understand why the cancer test is accepted with such kind of wrong probability for not having cancer but getting positive result.

P(cancer|- result) = P(no cancer and - result) / P(- result) = P(no cancer and - result) / (P(no cancer and - result) + P(no cancer and + result)=15%*1% / (15%*1%+85%*99%) = 0.178%

It is only 0.2% that I have cancer and this test shows negative result.
It is the probability what everybody except, may no surprise of them but would be highlighted to understand why this test is so useful in the world.

What really matters is how much the distribution of the maximum interval and the minimum interval. There are many very large gold returns between 0.36 and 1.2, so gold returns have most spread. Bond returns are entirely between -11% and 33%, so Bonds have the least spread.

REIT SKEW : -0.773

I thought if the SKEW() value is closer to 0 then it is more normally distributed, and that would be ""Bonds"", followed by ""REIT"", and then ""Gold"".

If I play 10,000 games of craps and bet the same amount on each game, what is the probability that IΓÇÖm not losing money?

Mean Amount ahead = -140 standard deviation, Amount ahead = 99.99. Chance not behind is chance winnings are greater than or equal to 0 and we use -0.5 because 0 probability is approximate by chance normal random variable is between -0.5 and 0.5.

I can get to the correct answer using binomial distribution 0.079254534 == 1-BINOM.DIST(5000, 10000, 0.493, TRUE) but I don't see what is happening with any of the figures given in the explanation formula. I don't understand what is meant by ""Mean amount ahead is -140"" etc

If someone follows the approach here would you please take a moment to try to explain the logic?

M1L5HW3 question 2 discrepency,"In question 2 it asks ""Which hospital has a higher percentage of survival for low risk patients?"" to which i answered CH because when i view my pivottable count of outcomes with show value as % of Column Total as well as % of Parent Row Total in both cases CH is larger than ER.  I have pivot table Rows configured to have Hospital and under that Risk Category.  The submit this response is considered wrong and ER is considered correct.  I get the right answer using my pivottable for question 1 & 3.  Attaching image of my pivot table output.

Skewness and Kurtosis ,"In ""Testing Equality of Variances"" sub-module Wayne says when testing for equality of variances we should check that we have normal populations by Skewness and Kurtosis ranging from (-1:1) or (1:-1) because these values are consistent with a normal distribution. 

But while solving the homework and quiz questions I have in few occasions came across values lower or higher than the +1:-1 range.  

e.g: ![][1]

In the image above Kurtosis for Cedar Falls is below the -1 range. Should I still consider Cedar Falls as a normal distribution and proceed with the calculations? Or this -1.136 values will interfere in some way?

Apologies if my question is confusing but I can't help since I am confused myself.

Thank you.

confusing example in statistics overview course pre-reading document,"In the course pre-reading document, statistics overview for essentials course.pdf / statistics primer - a brief overview of basic statistical and probability principles, there is a probability example ""If you toss a die five times, what is the probability that at least one of your tosses results in a 2?"".

The answer provided uses the law of compliments to determine the result based on the 1 - (probability of not rolling a 2 on five tries) = 1 - (5/6 * 5/6 * 5/6 * 5/6 * 5/6) = 0.5981.  Yes a convenient example of how the law of compliments, discussed earlier in document, can be used.  

What has me confused is why i cannot arrive at the same answer calculating the probability using the Unions (or the Probability of A or B with Independent Events) section math where this example is surfaced. In other words (probability of rolling a 2 on at least one of five rolls) = ( (probability of rolling 2 on 1st roll) + (probability of rolling 2 on 2nd roll) + . . . (probability of rolling 2 on 5th roll) ) - ( (probability of rolling 2 on first roll) x (probability of rolling 2 on 2nd roll) x . . . (probability of rolling 2 on 5th roll) ) = (1/6+1/6+1/6+1/6+1/6) - (1/6*1/6*1/6*1/6*1/6) = 0.8332 .

a correction to the guess of Mr. Winston; RANK.AVG function; if there are same values in the data,"I tried what Mr. Winston said about ranking. I prepared a data set ""scores"" which includes twice the score of 1; includes three times the score of 2; includes four times the score of 3; and includes once the scores of 4, 5, 6, 7. I used RANK.AVG function with ascending order. I add a picture of it below. What I see is different from what Mr. Winston said. For the scores of 2, there are three times the scores of 2 and RANK.AVG didn't give a value such as 2.33. (Mr. Winston had said that: ""*If three tied, **I guess** it would be 21.33, something like that.*"" - I also added what he said below.)

if there are same values in the data, RANK.AVG formula gives the rank of middle value of these values.

More precisely, it gives the average of ranks of the values if there are same values in the data.

If the number of values are odd, (I mean If there are 3, 5, 7 etc. number of values), RANK.AVG function gives the rank of the middle value for all of these same values. Let's say, there are three same values, it will give the rank of the second one (second one is the middle of three values). Or let's say, there are nine same values, it will give the rank of the fifth one (fifth one is the middle of nine values). In my example, which I added its picture in this post, there are three times the score of 2 (In A4, A5, and A6 cells). Because the rank of the middle value is 4 (it is score of 2 in A5 cell), excel gives the rank of 4 for all scores of 2. (B4, B5, B6 all of them are 4)

If the number of values are even, (I mean If there are 2, 4, 6 etc. number of values), RANK.AVG function gives the rank of the middle value for all of these same values. If the number of values are even, excel gives a decimal which ends with .5 because there isn't an exact middle value. There are two middle values. It will give the averages of ranks. Let's say, there are four same values, it will give the rank of the middle values. Because there isn't an exact value between 2nd and 3rd values, excel takes the rank of the second value and adds .5 integer. It means its rank is between 2nd and 3rd values. In my example, which I added its picture in this post, there are four times the score of 3 (In A7, A8, A9 and A10 cells). The ranks of middle values for the scores of 3 are 7 and 8. So, it gives the rank of 7.5 for the all the scores of 3.

![ranks for same values][1]

Now, I'm giving a more striking example. Its picture is below. In scoresA column, there are seven times the value of 8. I used RANK.AVG function. As you see, it says their ranks are 4. (E2:E8 cells). Because the rank of middle value is 4. (I made the color of the text red for middle value, here middle value is D5)
In scoresB column, there are six times the value of 8. I used RANK.AVG function. There are 6 values. So, there are 2 middle values. (Again, I made text color for middle values red, as you see in the picture.) The rank of these middle values are 3 and 4. Excel gives the average of the ranks of middle values: (3+4)/2=3.5 (or average of ranks of the all same values, it doesn't matter; the result will be same= (1+2+3+4+5+6)/6=3.5 as you see the result is same and it is 3.5)

![a more striking example about RANK.AVG][2]

Course Module 1 : Descriptive Statistics / Descriptive Statistics with Analysis ToolPak / RANK, LARGE, and SMALL Functions

Here is what Mr. Winston said in RANK, LARGE, and SMALL Functions class at 04:30 in the video:

""So I can type, RANK.AVG.
We want the number, is right there.
And then I want scores, and then I want 0,
highest score would be ascending.
Highest score is a 1.
Okay, so you can see here these two guys got
a rank of 24.5 like I discussed, because of the ties.
If three tied, I guess it would be 21.33, something like that.
But Excel knows to give those tied ranks.
Which I think it makes more sense to see 24.5 twice than two 24s there.
So that concludes our discussion for
now of typical Excel statistical functions.""

There is no difference between SECOND and FIRST.

M2L5HW3 Cab color actually green,"So the problem is:
85% of all cabs are blue and the rest are green. A cab identified in a hit and run accident is identified as green. People can correctly identify the color of a cab 80% of the time. When surveyed, most Stanford students thought there was an 80% chance the cab is actually green.
1st question: Do you agree? 
I guess the it would be better if the wording were Do you agree that the car's color is actually green? Or something like that.

And what I don't understand is in the solution we are calculating with P(SAYS GREEN|GREEN) = 0.80. I assume that is because: People can correctly identify the color of a cab 80% of the time.
But there is another condition: When surveyed, most Stanford students thought there was an 80% chance the cab is actually green. That seem to be ignored. Why? Or if it was not ignored then when it was used in the calculations?

I have a question of M5L5HW1?,"**Question**:
A cell phone chip vendor needs to prove that they are producing at most 1% defective chips. Design an appropriate null and alternative hypotheses. In a sample of 500 chips from a large population, suppose 10 were defective. For ╬▒ = 0.05, would you conclude that the new vendor's chips contain at most 1% defective chips?

H0 : P>=P0 and H1: P<P0

H0 : P>= 0.01 and H1 :P<0.01 

then use binom.dist.range(trials, prob, a, b)
is it supposed that **binom.dist.range(500, 0.01, 0, 10)**  so the p-value should be *0.986756433* which is not significant 
so we cannot reject H0 

i think this is legit because 10 defect in 500 samples. The proportion should be *10/500* or *2%*

The answer in the homework is **We reject Ho; the p-value is 0.0311**
which derived from **binom.dist.range(500, 0.01, 10, 500)**

"Hi, Everyone!","Hey, all - I'm Trish, and I live a little north of Seattle, Washington, USA.  

I'm here for a couple of reasons:

 1. I'm a learning addict, and I generally always have some sort of class or self-study project going.  If I'm not learning, I feel like my brain is turning to mush!
 2. Data science is a fascinating area, and I've always been interested in what can be gleaned from digging into the data, its structure and context.  That requires a solid grasp of statistics, and this course will be a great way to refresh classes I took a few years ago, while adding a slightly different focus.
 3. I'm taking the Microsoft Professional Certification for Data Science because I want to put a little jog in my career - I've been involved in software test/quality assurance for a long time now, and I'm ready to try the waters with something that still uses my tech skills but is a hot specialization.  I think this certificate program will get me started.

interpretation of a real life clinical study reported snippet of statistics,"I was reading this article https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/press-releases/2012/PLCOScreening cover differences in mortality outcomes for people who used sigmoidoscopy vs colonoscopy vs nothing screening.

I was doing okay following the study reported statistical outcomes until this snippet I pasted below which i'm hoping someone who understands statistics, e.g. our course instructors or TAs or savvy students, are able to clarify. 

My take away is they are saying the protocol of having sigmoidoscopy screenings, followed by colonoscopy screening only if something suspect was found, reduced the number of distal colon cancer incidence and for those where it did progress it reduced the mortality[/death] outcomes. They then also say that the protocol didn't reduce mortality[/death] outcomes for proximal colon cancer but did reduce the incidence of it. This to me suggests that proximal colon cancer is addressable if you catch it during benign or malignant polyp stage but not once it had progressed into something more significant, e.g. a tumor.

&lt;snip&gt;<br>
The incidence of distal colorectal cancer was reduced by 29 percent, and mortality from distal colorectal cancer was reduced by 50 percent, in the screening group.  While there was no statistically significant decline in deaths from proximal colorectal cancer, the incidence of proximal colorectal cancer was reduced by 14 percent in the screening group.

How to Calculate the total sample space (number of outcomes),"Hi,

I wonder if I have understood how to properly calculate the sample space to find the total number of outcomes. Not by listing them visually but calculating the end result. 

Let's use the tossing of a 6 sided dice and a 4 sided dice.

**Is the following correct?**

The total possible outcomes of these two dices per toss is 
6 * 4 = 24 possible outcomes. 

**To calculate X tosses, does it work like this?**

1 toss: 24^1 = 24

2 toss: 24^2 = 576

3 toss: 24^3 = 13824

4 toss. 24^4 = 331776

x toss. 24^x

etc.

So the formula to find the total sample space (number of outcomes) if I'm correct would be

**Sample space formula for x toss** 

(  Total possible outcomes for dice A  * Total possible outcomes for dice b  ) ^x

*Where X is the number of tosses with both dices*",10319234,0,0,0,0,1.0,,,Microsoft+DAT222x+4T2017,CommentThread,2017-11-09T09:15:53.685Z

M3L3HW1 clarification,"In M3L3HW1 it asks ""You toss two dice fifty times. Find the mean, variance, and standard deviation of the total number of dots showing.""

The ""Show Answer"" details state to just treat this like a single die tossed 100 times in which case mean = 1/6 * (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6) * 100 = 350 and variance = 1/6 * ((1-3.5)^2 + (2-3.5)^2 + (3-3.5)^2 + (4-3.5)^2 + (5-3.5)^2 + (6-3.5)^2) * 100 = 292 [ or = (1/6 * (1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 + 6^2) - 3.5^2) * 100 = 292 ] and sd = sqrt(292) = 17.08.

I tried to get the same numbers treating it like two die, S = {2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12} thrown 50 times in which case mean = =1/11 * (2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10+11+12) * 50 = 350 [ correct result ] and variance = 1/11 * ((2-7)^2 + (3-7)^2 + (4-7)^2 + (5-7)^2 + (6-7)^2 + (7-7)^2 + (8-7)^2 + (9-7)^2 + (10-7)^2 + (11-7)^2 + (12-7)^2) * 50 = 500 [ not 292 ] and sd = sqrt(500) = 22.36 [ not 17.08 ].

So I tried to answer this on the premise that I was dealing with a discrete random variable that has values 40 * 2 = 80 w/ P = .6 and 40 * 0.5 = 20  w/ P = 0.4 and that produced a mean [ 56 ] that didn't match any of the multiple choice answers [ 15, 16, 17, 18 ] and a stddev [ 29.39 ] which did match one of the multiple choice provided answers, the one with mean = 16.  If I select that option its considered the right answer so clarification i'm looking for is what did I do wrong with my mean calculation arrived at using 80*.6 + 20*.4 = 56 ?",13739955,0,0,0,0,2.0,,,Microsoft+DAT222x+4T2017,CommentThread,2017-11-10T02:07:16.652Z

,"Set up a table of Liars/Not liars vs Detected/Not detected.  Assume the table is for 1000 people.  You know that the totals of the rows are 1 and 999. and the detector  results are correct 98% of the time.  So the first row (Liars), has .98 (of a person) and .02*1=.02 of a person in it.  The second row has .02*999=19.96 people in it and .98*999=979.02 people in it.  Since you want to know what the chances are of a liar being detected, you need to look at the relative sizes of the entries in the 'detected' column.  Compute .98/(.98+19.96), which is .04675573, or .05 rounded to two decimals.  Since all the ""solutions"" were rounded, I assume it was OK to round, and I don't remember if it told you to round or not.

It would seem I have been confusing what my initial pivot table setups were using to produce Count of Outcome | Show Values As % . . . displayed output as having to do with outcomes when in fact it was just counting up CH and Risk subcategory hits.  I created an updated set of pivot tables this time where I have a Sum of Outcome | Show Values As % . . . displayed output and using an if statement to convert outcome ""Live"" and ""Die"" entries to ""1"" and ""0"" values.  Using this approach i'm still getting the fact that CH has the highest ""Live"" results and not ER.

Any tips on what Rows, [ Columns, ] and Values settings my pivot table needs to have configured in order to get the result where ER Low risk patients have the highest % of ""Live"" Outcomes?

A company with 500 employees wants to estimate the fraction of employees whose commute to work exceeds 60 minutes. They survey 200 employees and find 60% of those surveyed have a commute exceeding 60 minutes. They are 95% confident that the actual fraction of employees whose commute exceeds 60 minutes is within which of the following ranges? Apply the finite correction factor to your answer.

,"Thanks for response.  What does the ""for placing"" and ""if placing"" terminology you use mean?  Is this some statistics term for randomly selecting an item from a bowl, hat, bucket, deck?

My question is really around why the probability math I show above doesn't produce the desired 5/9 answer.  Similarly in your example you are quoting the probability of drawing the 2nd ball as being blue to arrive at 5[blue balls remaining]/9[total balls remaining] vs the 1st ball drawn from bowl being 6[total blue balls to start with]/9[total balls to start with].  The question is asking for probability of first ball drawn is blue given 2nd ball is blue . . . so perhaps the answer is supposed to be 6/10 given 1st ball drawn is a completely independent event from color of whatever 2nd ball is drawn.

There is a subtlety in questions like this that I believe I am overlooking that is key to understanding how to calculate relevant probabilities.",13739955,0,0,0,0,,59fa76b450ef220a20002d19,59fa28babc04a609fe002e06,Microsoft+DAT222x+4T2017,Comment,2017-11-02T17:43:30.991Z

As is told in the video, Bayes Theorem essentially shows the share of true positive test results in the total of positive test results (true and false) and thereby gives an indication of the level of trust you can have in a positive test result.
